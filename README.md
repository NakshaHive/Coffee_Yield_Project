Methodology

Collected data on rainfall, temperature, and coffee yield.

Plotted graphs to visualize the relationship between these factors and yield.

Observed trends and patterns to draw conclusions about optimal conditions.

Results / Observations

Coffee yield increases as rainfall increases from 100 mm to 300 mm.

Coffee yield increases as temperature rises from 22°C to 26°C.

Rainfall and temperature both have a positive effect on coffee production.
